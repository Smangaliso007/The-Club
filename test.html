                    <h3>MESSAGE TO YOU</h3>
                        <p>Simply put, this is a blog and welcome. Not so simply put, it is an attempt at dealing with social issues,
                            which could be argued is the purpose of a publication- to publish meaningful content that will help us connect to our common goal.
                            Begs some questions, at least we hope, questions like what social issues are we dealing with and most importantly how does our form
                            of action intend to attempt to deal with social issues, if this too is to be considered a publication then it stands to reason that
                            there is a common goal at play just as much i.e. the unity of Africans of all racial persuasion. Most agree that our current society
                            has problems that require our utmost attention, but often times we speak as though we are oblivious to the fact that there are many
                            variant societies which often exist under other societies or parallel to each other and some are even cross-societies- one could argue
                            that most if not all as a matter of fact are cross-societies, each inheriting elements of the other that coincide with the logical
                            fundamentals of each to help societies understand & interpret the world, however this often times threatens one or the other society
                            and when that society does not rise to the occasion it is converted by means of understanding & consequently control.</p>
