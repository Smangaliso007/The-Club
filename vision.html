                    <h4>VISION</h4>
                        <p>Currently South Africa is in the stage of an economic revolution, still pursuing the decolonization of the economic systems in function
                            which could be used to argue for the statement that South Africa and thereby Africa is still colonized. There have been many an African
                            country who have attempted to implement the democratic system such as in  South Africa- especially since South Africa boasts one of the
                            most prominent economies in Africa, and there has always been an almost indistinguishable relation between the prosperity of a countries
                            political governance and the success of its economy- yet not many have succeed failing the balance/control over economy due to inadequate
                            political governance. Whilst our South Africa has subtly claimed a leadership role in the African economy as well as Political arena, we
                            have not done the necessary work to liberate power from the hands of the consequences of Colonialism and it could be argued that its the
                            very pursuit of an Economic revolution that has faulted South Africans into apparent mayhem. When you consider the 5-point list above as
                            a guide through decolonization you might have the question of whether or not it would've been better to target Economic freedom before
                            Political, however now that we are where we are, here's another question, when South Africa achieved the elections of an African President
                            was it then the end of the purpose of the Political Fight?</p>
