                    <h3>MESSAGE TO YOU</h3>
                        <p>Simply put, this is a blog and welcome. Not so simply put, it is an attempt at dealing with social issues,
                            which could be argued is the purpose of a publication- to publish meaningful content that will help us connect to our common goal.
                            Begs some questions, at least we hope, questions like what social issues are we dealing with and most importantly how does our form
                            of action intend to attempt to deal with social issues, if this too is to be considered a publication then it stands to reason that
                            there is a common goal at play just as much i.e. the unity of Africans of all racial persuasion. Most agree that our current society
                            has problems that require our utmost attention, but often times we speak as though we are oblivious to the fact that there are many
                            variant societies which often exist under other societies or parallel to each other and some are even cross-societies- one could argue
                            that most if not all as a matter of fact are cross-societies, each inheriting elements of the other that coincide with the logical
                            fundamentals of each to help societies understand & interpret the world, however this often times threatens one or the other society
                            and when that society does not rise to the occasion it is converted by means of understanding & consequently control.</p>

                    <h4>VISION</h4>
                        <p>Currently South Africa is in the stage of an economic revolution, still pursuing the decolonization of the economic systems in function
                            which could be used to argue for the statement that South Africa and thereby Africa is still colonized. There have been many an African
                            country who have attempted to implement the democratic system such as in  South Africa- especially since South Africa boasts one of the
                            most prominent economies in Africa, and there has always been an almost indistinguishable relation between the prosperity of a countries
                            political governance and the success of its economy- yet not many have succeed failing the balance/control over economy due to inadequate
                            political governance. Whilst our South Africa has subtly claimed a leadership role in the African economy as well as Political arena, we
                            have not done the necessary work to liberate power from the hands of the consequences of Colonialism and it could be argued that its the
                            very pursuit of an Economic revolution that has faulted South Africans into apparent mayhem. When you consider the 5-point list above as
                            a guide through decolonization you might have the question of whether or not it would've been better to target Economic freedom before
                            Political, however now that we are where we are, here's another question, when South Africa achieved the elections of an African President
                            was it then the end of the purpose of the Political Fight?</p>
                </div>
            </div>
                <!-- This is the second grid-block -->
            <div class="goals">
                <div class="mission">
                    <h4>MISSION</h4>
                        <p>The answer of course would be no as the purpose of fighting for Political Freedom was to allow Economic Freedom as it wasn't. The objective
                            wasn't to show that we can through one country, rather to have the unity in numbers for Political Freedom to matter, because right now we
                            are divided in Economy, Society, Culture, Spirit and even in Politics which threatens to defeat the purpose of give or take 100 years of
                            fighting for a liberated Black people and more even years of lost fathers, single mothers as well as lost & broken children. One could argue
                            that to be the basis of drug abuse, violent crimes and the general sense of indifference that has taken over, the compounded inheritance of
                            'disorderly' behavior. </p>
