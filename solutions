1. Divide the content into pages themselves so:
    1.1 Vision, Mission into separate pages but leave the video
        on the Home page.
(***DONE***)

2. Do the CSS for @Media queries
    2.1 The FONT all around (***DONE***)
    2.2 The SIZE of the IMAGES (***DONE***)
    2.3 SIZE of the HEADER which is actually just the FONT (**DONE**)
    2.4 The SIZE of the VIDEO (***DONE***)
    2.5 SO YOU DECIDED ON DOING THREE TYPES OF DEVICES
        2.5.1 299PX-768PX- (***AND THIS ONE IS ABOUT DONE***)
        2.5.2 769PX-1300PX  (**DONE WITH THIS SECTION OF THE CSS***)
        2.5.3 1300PX-1610PX (***THIS IS SORT OF THE DEFAULT CONFIG***)

3. Make sure the HOVER FUNCTION occurs at the MENU BUTTON
    3.1 Remove the HEADER UNDERLINE
    3.2 Instead create a HEADER BAR/SIDE NAVIGATION(LEFT)
(***DONE-SORTA well we sort of did it another way which works just fine as we would have hoped
        obviously as we accept it***)

4. GODDAMN IT! PUT SOME CONTENT ONTO THERE

5. ADD IMAGES FROM THE VIDEO AS THE BACKGROUND ON VISION AND MISSION AS WELL AS HOME
