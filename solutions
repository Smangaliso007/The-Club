1. Divide the content into pages themselves so:
    1.1 Vision, Mission into separate pages but leave the video
        on the Home page.
(***DONE***)

2. Do the CSS for @Media queries
    2.1 The FONT all around
    2.2 The SIZE of the IMAGES
    2.3 SIZE of the HEADER which is actually just the FONT
    2.4 The SIZE of the VIDEO

3. Make sure the HOVER FUNCTION occurs at the MENU BUTTON
    3.1 Remove the HEADER UNDERLINE
    3.2 Instead create a HEADER BAR/SIDE NAVIGATION(LEFT)
(***DONE-SORTA well we sort of did it another way which works just fine as we would have hoped
        obviously as we accept it***)

4. GODDAMN IT! PUT SOME CONTENT ONTO THERE

5. ADD IMAGES FROM THE VIDEO AS THE BACKGROUND ON VISION AND MISSION AS WELL AS HOME
